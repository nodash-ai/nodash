### Example AI Conversation Flow

```
Human: Help me add analytics to my React app

AI: I'll help you integrate Nodash analytics into your React application. Let me start by analyzing your project structure.

[Uses analyze_project tool]

Based on the analysis, I can see you have a React application with TypeScript. Let me generate a comprehensive implementation guide for you.

[Uses implementation_guide tool with framework: "react", language: "typescript"]

Now let me show you some event templates that would be relevant for your application type.

[Uses get_event_templates tool]

**CLI Installation** (optional but recommended):
```bash
# Install globally for enhanced functionality
npm install -g @nodash/cli

# Verify installation
nodash --version
```

## ü§ù Integration with Local Agents

This MCP server is designed to work perfectly with local coding agents:

- **MCP Server Role**: Provides analysis, guidance, and recommendations
- **Local Agent Role**: Implements the actual code changes with full project context
- **Perfect Partnership**: MCP analyzes and suggests, agent implements with precision

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MCP server not starting**
- Ensure Node.js ‚â• 18.0.0 is installed
- Check that the MCP client configuration is correct
- Try running `npx @nodash/mcp-server@latest` directly

**Project analysis failing**
- Ensure you're running from a directory with a `package.json`
- Check file permissions for the project directory
- Verify the project structure is accessible

**Examples not loading**
- Check that the examples directory exists relative to the MCP server
- Ensure file permissions allow reading example files
- Try accessing examples through the resources

### üÜï CLI Integration Issues

**CLI not detected**
- Install the CLI: `npm install -g @nodash/cli`
- Verify installation: `nodash --version`
- Check PATH configuration
- Server will fall back to MCP-only mode automatically

**CLI commands failing**
- Check API token configuration: Use `execute_cli_command` with `config list`
- Verify network connectivity: Use `execute_cli_command` with `health`
- Review command syntax and permissions
- Commands default to dry-run mode for safety

**Workflow execution issues**
- Use `troubleshoot_issues` tool for automated diagnostics
- Check individual command execution first
- Verify project structure and permissions
- Review workflow logs for specific failure points

**Security validation errors**
- Commands are automatically sanitized for security
- Destructive operations require explicit confirmation
- Use dry-run mode to test commands safely
- Review security policy for allowed commands and arguments

### Getting Help

1. Use the `readme` tool for comprehensive usage instructions
2. Use the `troubleshoot_issues` tool for automated CLI diagnostics
3. Check the troubleshooting prompts for specific issues
4. Review the error messages - they include helpful suggestions and code examples
5. üÜï Use `validate_implementation` for comprehensive setup validation
