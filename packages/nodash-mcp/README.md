# Nodash MCP Server

**AI-powered development assistant for analytics integration**

The Nodash MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is a development-time tool that helps AI agents understand and implement Nodash analytics in your projects. It provides code analysis, implementation guidance, and working examples rather than runtime analytics functionality.

## üéØ Purpose

This MCP server is designed to help developers and AI agents:
- **Analyze projects** for analytics integration opportunities
- **Generate implementation guides** with step-by-step instructions
- **Provide code examples** for different frameworks
- **Validate event schemas** and suggest improvements
- **Access working examples** from the examples directory

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### For Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nodash": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@nodash/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Other MCP Clients

```bash
# Run directly
npx @nodash/mcp-server@latest

# Or install globally
npm install -g @nodash/mcp-server
nodash-mcp-server
```

## üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Recommended AI Agent Workflow

1. **Project Analysis**: Start with `analyze_project` to understand the codebase
2. **Advanced Insights**: Use `advanced_analysis` for comprehensive recommendations
3. **Implementation Plan**: Get `implementation_guide` for step-by-step instructions
4. **Event Design**: Use `get_event_templates` and `validate_event_schema` for event planning
5. **Code Generation**: Use `generate_tracking_code` for framework-specific examples
6. **Example Reference**: Access working examples through resources

### Example AI Conversation Flow

```
Human: Help me add analytics to my React app

AI: I'll help you integrate Nodash analytics into your React application. Let me start by analyzing your project structure.

[Uses analyze_project tool]

Based on the analysis, I can see you have a React application with TypeScript. Let me generate a comprehensive implementation guide for you.

[Uses implementation_guide tool with framework: "react", language: "typescript"]

Now let me show you some event templates that would be relevant for your application type.

[Uses get_event_templates tool]

Here's a complete step-by-step plan with code examples...
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/nodash.git
cd nodash/packages/nodash-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the server
npm run build

# Run locally
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## üìã Requirements

- **Node.js** ‚â• 18.0.0
- **NPM** or compatible package manager
- **MCP-compatible client** (Claude Desktop, etc.)

## üîß Configuration

The MCP server works out of the box with no configuration required. It automatically:
- Detects your project structure
- Finds the examples directory
- Caches analysis results for performance
- Provides context-aware recommendations

## ü§ù Integration with Local Agents

This MCP server is designed to work perfectly with local coding agents:

- **MCP Server Role**: Provides analysis, guidance, and recommendations
- **Local Agent Role**: Implements the actual code changes with full project context
- **Perfect Partnership**: MCP analyzes and suggests, agent implements with precision

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MCP server not starting**
- Ensure Node.js ‚â• 18.0.0 is installed
- Check that the MCP client configuration is correct
- Try running `npx @nodash/mcp-server@latest` directly

**Project analysis failing**
- Ensure you're running from a directory with a `package.json`
- Check file permissions for the project directory
- Verify the project structure is accessible

**Examples not loading**
- Check that the examples directory exists relative to the MCP server
- Ensure file permissions allow reading example files
- Try accessing examples through the resources

### Getting Help

1. Use the `readme` tool for comprehensive usage instructions
2. Check the troubleshooting prompts for specific issues
3. Review the error messages - they include helpful suggestions and code examples
