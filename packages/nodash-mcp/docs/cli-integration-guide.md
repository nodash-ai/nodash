    "verboseOutput": false
  }
}
```

**Available Workflows**:
- **setup**: Complete project setup and configuration
- **validation**: Comprehensive implementation validation
- **health-check**: Service health and connectivity testing

## Security Considerations

### Command Validation
All CLI commands go through multiple security layers:

1. **Allowed Commands**: Only specific commands are permitted
   - `config` - Configuration management
   - `track` - Event tracking
   - `metric` - Metric sending
   - `health` - Health checks
   - `analyze` - Project analysis

2. **Argument Sanitization**: Dangerous arguments are blocked
   - `--force`, `--no-confirm`, `-f` are restricted
   - Input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks

3. **Confirmation Requirements**: Destructive operations require explicit confirmation
   - Token configuration changes
   - Non-dry-run operations

### Token Security
- Tokens are validated for format and length
- Tokens are masked in logs and output
- Secure storage mechanisms are used

## Workflow Examples
