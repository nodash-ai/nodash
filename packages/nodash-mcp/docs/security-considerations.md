# Security Considerations for CLI Integration

This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and considerations for the CLI integration features of the Nodash MCP Server.

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Approach

The CLI integration implements a comprehensive security model with multiple layers of protection:

1. **Command Validation Layer**
2. **Input Sanitization Layer**
3. **Permission Control Layer**
4. **Execution Safety Layer**
5. **Token Security Layer**

## Command Validation

### Allowed Commands Whitelist

Only specific commands are permitted for execution:

```typescript
const ALLOWED_COMMANDS = [
  'config',    // Configuration management
  'track',     // Event tracking
  'metric',    // Metric sending
  'health',    // Health checks
  'analyze'    // Project analysis
];
```

**Security Rationale**: Prevents execution of arbitrary system commands that could compromise security.

### Restricted Arguments Blacklist

Dangerous arguments are automatically blocked:

```typescript
const RESTRICTED_ARGS = [
  '--force',      // Bypass safety checks
  '--no-confirm', // Skip confirmations
  '-f',          // Force flag
  '--delete',    // Deletion operations
  '--remove'     // Removal operations
];
```

**Security Rationale**: Prevents bypassing safety mechanisms and destructive operations.

## Input Sanitization

### Character Filtering

All input is sanitized to remove potentially dangerous characters:

```typescript
function sanitizeInput(input: string): string {
  // Remove command injection characters
  return input.replace(/[;&|`$()]/g, '');
}
```

**Protected Against**:
- Command injection attacks
- Shell metacharacter exploitation
- Process substitution attacks

### Argument Validation

Each command argument is individually validated:
- Length limits to prevent buffer overflow attempts
- Character set restrictions based on expected input type
- Format validation for structured data (tokens, URLs, etc.)

## Permission Control

### Confirmation Requirements

Certain operations require explicit confirmation:

1. **Token Configuration**: Setting or changing API tokens
2. **Non-Dry-Run Operations**: Commands that make actual changes
3. **Destructive Operations**: Any command that could modify or delete data

### Dry-Run Default

All commands default to dry-run mode unless explicitly overridden:

```typescript
const command: CLICommand = {
  command: 'track',
  args: ['event_name'],
  options: { 
    dryRun: true  // Default to safe mode
  }
};
```

**Security Benefit**: Prevents accidental execution of commands that could affect production systems.

## Execution Safety

### Process Isolation

CLI commands are executed in isolated processes:
- Separate process space prevents memory corruption
- Limited environment variables reduce information leakage
- Timeout controls prevent resource exhaustion

### Resource Limits

Execution is bounded by resource limits:

```typescript
const EXECUTION_LIMITS = {
  timeout: 30000,        // 30 second timeout
  maxOutputSize: 1048576, // 1MB output limit
  maxConcurrent: 5       // Maximum concurrent executions
};
```

### Error Handling

Secure error handling prevents information disclosure:
- Sensitive information is masked in error messages
- Stack traces are sanitized before display
- Error codes are mapped to safe, user-friendly messages

## Token Security

### Token Validation

API tokens undergo comprehensive validation:

```typescript
function validateToken(token: string): boolean {
  return token && 
         token.length >= 10 && 
         /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/.test(token);
}
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- Minimum length requirement (10+ characters)
- Alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens only
- No special characters that could be used for injection

### Token Masking

Tokens are automatically masked in logs and output:

```typescript
function maskToken(token: string): string {
  if (token.length <= 8) return '***';
  return `${token.slice(0, 4)}...${token.slice(-4)}`;
}
```

**Example**: `abcd1234567890efgh` becomes `abcd...efgh`

### Secure Storage

Tokens are handled securely throughout the system:
- Never logged in plain text
- Encrypted in transit
- Secure storage mechanisms used where applicable

## Network Security

### HTTPS Enforcement

All API communications use HTTPS:
- TLS 1.2+ required for all connections
- Certificate validation enforced
- No fallback to insecure protocols

### Request Validation

API requests are validated before transmission:
- Payload size limits
- Content type validation
- Header sanitization

## Audit and Monitoring

### Command Logging

All CLI command executions are logged with:
- Timestamp of execution
- Command and sanitized arguments
- Execution result (success/failure)
- User context (when available)

**Example Log Entry**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "command": "config list",
  "result": "success",
  "duration": 150,
  "user": "mcp-client"
}
```

### Security Event Monitoring

Security-relevant events are specially logged:
- Failed command validation attempts
- Blocked dangerous arguments
- Authentication failures
- Unusual execution patterns

## Best Practices for Users

### Development Environment

1. **Use Dry-Run Mode**: Always test commands in dry-run mode first
2. **Validate Tokens**: Ensure tokens have minimal required permissions
3. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate API tokens regularly
4. **Monitor Usage**: Review command execution logs periodically

### Production Environment

1. **Restricted Tokens**: Use tokens with minimal required permissions
2. **Network Isolation**: Run MCP server in isolated network segments
3. **Access Control**: Limit who can interact with the MCP server
4. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and alerting

### Token Management

1. **Secure Generation**: Use strong, randomly generated tokens
2. **Scope Limitation**: Limit token permissions to required operations only
3. **Expiration**: Set appropriate token expiration times
4. **Revocation**: Have procedures for immediate token revocation

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Secure configuration through environment variables:

```bash
# Security settings
NODASH_MCP_SECURITY_LEVEL=strict
NODASH_MCP_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=true
NODASH_MCP_DEFAULT_DRY_RUN=true
NODASH_MCP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=30000
```

### Runtime Security Checks

The MCP server performs runtime security validation:

```typescript
// Startup security validation
async function validateSecurityConfiguration(): Promise<void> {
  // Check file permissions
  // Validate environment configuration
  // Test security controls
  // Verify isolation mechanisms
}
```

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats

1. **Command Injection**: Malicious input attempting to execute arbitrary commands
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Attempts to execute commands with elevated privileges
3. **Information Disclosure**: Attempts to extract sensitive information
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Attempts to consume excessive system resources
5. **Token Compromise**: Unauthorized access to API tokens

### Mitigations

1. **Command Injection**: Input sanitization and command whitelisting
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Process isolation and permission controls
3. **Information Disclosure**: Output sanitization and error handling
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Execution limits and timeout controls
5. **Token Compromise**: Token validation and secure handling

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Handling

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts on security events
2. **Containment**: Immediate blocking of suspicious activities
3. **Investigation**: Detailed logging enables forensic analysis
4. **Recovery**: Graceful fallback to MCP-only mode if needed
5. **Prevention**: Security controls updated based on incidents

### Emergency Procedures

**Immediate Actions for Security Incidents**:
1. Disable CLI integration if compromise suspected
2. Revoke potentially compromised tokens
3. Review audit logs for unauthorized activities
4. Notify relevant stakeholders
5. Document incident for future prevention
